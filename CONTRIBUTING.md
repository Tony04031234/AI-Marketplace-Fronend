## Getting Started

### Issues

Issues are created when you see something that's wrong or missing, and think you know how to fix it. That can be anything from a typo in the docs to a serious bug in the code to a radical new idea for a feature. When you create an issue, you create a formal record that this thing (whatever it is) needs attention.
