# GPT4 powered application

Project Description: Your startup aims to create a web application that provides users with a variety of AI-powered services, such as generating presentations, summarizing text, generating code, and processing images. The frontend is built using React, and the backend is implemented with Flask.

Hosting and Deployment: The application is planned to be hosted on Google Cloud. The frontend will be hosted on Google Cloud Storage and served using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for low latency and high transfer speeds. The backend will be deployed as a containerized application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to ensure scalability and high availability. A regional external HTTP(S) load balancer will be used to distribute incoming traffic to the backend services.

Backend Services: The backend services will be developed using Flask, and they'll expose RESTful APIs to be consumed by the frontend. The backend will provide services such as generating presentations, summarizing text, generating code, and processing images.

Frontend: The frontend is built using React and provides a user interface to interact with the backend services. Users can select the desired AI-powered service, provide input (e.g., text, images), and receive the output, such as a presentation, a text summary, or generated code.

System Design: The system is designed to be scalable and highly available. The frontend is hosted on Google Cloud Storage and served using a CDN for optimal performance. The backend services are containerized and deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine, ensuring that the application can scale horizontally to handle increasing traffic. A regional external HTTP(S) load balancer is used to distribute traffic to the backend services efficiently.
